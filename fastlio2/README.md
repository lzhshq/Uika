## Notes

**Current State (Academic Reproduction):**

The code currently available in the `icra2026` branch contains the experimental implementation corresponding to our ICRA 2026 paper. It is provided for algorithm verification and academic reference. **It is not yet optimized for direct production deployment.**

**Upcoming Release (June 2026):**

We are currently conducting a comprehensive system refactoring based on **FineNav-Engine**—a dedicated C++20 development framework for robotics navigation. This upcoming release will be fully optimized for direct production deployment and accompanied by detailed documentation.

If you are interested in our work, please ⭐Star this repository to receive updates on the upcoming full release ;D

## What is FineNav?
FineNav is a navigation framework tailored for ground robots operating in unstructured 3D environments. It feaures on a cache-memory-like hierarchical mapping system, which achieves a favorable balance between low-latency real-time perception (for dynamic obstacle avoidance and terrain analysis), and scalable global storage (for large-scale 3D reasoning).

## Why FineNav?

### Versatile in various scenarios

The FineNav navigation framework is capable of dealing with various scenarios in unstructured environments within a unified pipeline, including:

### Low-latency perception with scalable reasoning

The core mapping system leverages a hierarchical architecture to balance latency and storage:
* **Ring-buffer based Local Grid:** Achieves $O(1)$ spatial shifts, enabling high-rate map updates and low-latency reactive perception.
* **Global OctoMap:** Maintains a persistent, memory-efficient 3D representation for large-scale spatial reasoning and cross-floor path planning.

The interaction mechanism between both maps is specifically designed to mirror a **cache-memory** model, effectively decoupling the real-time perception pipeline from costly global map updates:

### High usability and extensibility

FineNav is built upon a highly modular architecture of reusable components, ensuring that each module can be replaced or reconfigured independently.
Specifically, terrain analysis is tightly coupled with locomotion capability and is therefore exposed as a plugin. Developers can dynamically load custom analyzers without modifying the core system.

## How to use FineNav

The code currently available in the `icra2026` branch contains the experimental implementation corresponding to our ICRA 2026 paper. It is provided for algorithm verification and academic reference. **It is not yet optimized for direct production deployment.**
The production-ready version based on FineNav-Engine will be released soon.
